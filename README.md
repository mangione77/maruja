# Maruja ðŸ•µ

'Maruja' is a spanish word for a person who loves to gossip.

It's a website I made using React.js that can help showing how much are you sharing publicly on Facebook. It can also help on OSINT investigations, as showed by Mike Bazzel.

It is currently down due to Facebook changes in their API, but I'm working on a workaround tho. Keep tuned.

You can check a (really) rough version [here](http://maruja.surge.sh/). Be patient using it because the both frontend and backend are deployed in free services (Surge & Heroku) and requests might take a while.
